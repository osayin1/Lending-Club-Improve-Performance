# Lending-Club-Improve-Loan-ROI

This repository contains an IPython notebook that proposes a filter when making the decision whether to fund a loan.

Using the filter on a test set of over 37,000 loans, about 43% of the lons were rejected resulting in an average increase in overall ROI of 4.5%. The expected net gain in total profit after the filter was 12.5 Million Dollars.
