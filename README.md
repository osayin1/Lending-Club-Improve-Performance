# Lending-Club-Improve-Loan-ROI

This repository contains an IPython notebook that proposes a filter for investors when making the decision whether to fund a loan.
Using the filter on a test set of over 27,000 loans, about 44% of the lons were rejected resulting in an increase in overall ROI 
from -2.4% to 4.0%. The net gain in total profit after the filter was 15 Million Dollars.
